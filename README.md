# Morse-Code-Translator
Using a Raspberry Pi and button to translate morse code into text.
This is a one way translator that uses a bread board, button ,and some wires to create a system that can translate morse code into text.
The code outputs the resulting text after each character is input. In the beginning it mights be difficult to get the hang of the timing, but it comes with practice, so you can uncomment the lines that say: print(Morse) to see what you have outputted.
Due to a bug in the code, I've used an unconventional method to create spaces between words, which requires you to press the button for more than one second- I'll try to fix this soon.
The next couple updates should also include outputting the resulting text into speech using a microphone.
